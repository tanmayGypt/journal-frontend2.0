                Plagiarism is when an author attempts to pass off someone else
                work as his or her own. Duplicate publication, sometimes called
                self-plagiarism, occurs when an author reuses substantial parts
                of his or her own published work without providing the
                appropriate references. This can range from getting an identical
                paper published in multiple journals, to salami-slicing, where
                authors add small amounts of new data to a previous paper.
