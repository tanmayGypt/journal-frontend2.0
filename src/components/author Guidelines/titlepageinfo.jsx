            General points: Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of
            your original artwork. Embed the used fonts if the application
            provides that option. Aim to use the fonts Times New Roman. Number
            the illustrations according to their sequence in the text. Use a
            logical naming convention for your artwork files. Provide captions
            to illustrations separately. Size the illustrations close to the
            desired dimensions of the published version. Submit each
            illustration as a separate file.
